# UFO INVESTIGATIONS REFACTORED

This app is refactored from a group project. My intent is to gain experience in working with existing code by removing obsolete code, redesigning the visual aspects of the game, streamlining existing code, and recoding the logic of the game. I may move this into a React app in the future to explore how React handles simple games. 

The original readme is included below:

The goal with this group project was to create a full stack application utilzing the MVC framework. As part of this initiative, it was contingent upon each group member to attempt to ensure the proper functionality of their individual code, and then collectively attempt to ensure completely functionality of the total application once all code has been applied to the application.
